This package contains the XML schema definition for AutoYaST.

*Note: Some parts of the schema definition are imported from the respective
YaST modules.*

## Local Build

This package uses the [multibuild OBS feature](
https://openbuildservice.org/help/manuals/obs-user-guide/cha.obs.multibuild.html)
which allows to build several (sub)packages from the same sources.

You can build Å¡ packages from the sources:

- `yast2-schema-default` - contains full schema for all YaST packages
- `yast2-schema-micro` - smaller schema for minimized YaST installer,
  this is only used for some specific products
- `yast2-schema` - this is the same as the `yast2-schema-default` but can be used
  in products which do not have any "micro' variant.

To build a specific package locally run these commands:

- `yast2-schema` - `rake osc:build`
- `yast2-schema-default` - `rake "osc:build[-M default]"`
- `yast2-schema-micro` - `rake "osc:build[-M micro]"`
